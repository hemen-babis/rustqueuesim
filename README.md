# RustQueueSim

RustQueueSim is a simple queueing system simulation written in Rust. It models customers/jobs arriving over time, waiting in a FIFO queue, and being processed by a single server. The project logs metrics such as queue length, wait time, throughput, and server utilization.

This project is for the CS-423/523 Course Project at Portland State University.
